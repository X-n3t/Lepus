## Lepus  
**Sub-domain finder**

### [ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish) Fork
I have been using Lepus for a number of years as it is one of the better subdomain enumeration tools. I integrated some of the lessons learned from [DNS Queue](https://github.com/zephrfish/dns-parallel-prober) and added additional functionality to a project that had not been updated in over 2 years. So here is my forked edition with some fixes, additional features and active development to fix and add new things. If you want to help, make sure you document any pull requests :-).

In addition to new featues, I have also added the dataset from research I did in 2015 and integrated various lists to make a master subdomains.txt list. 

### About

**Lepus** is a utility for identifying and collecting subdomains for a given domain. Subdomain discovery is a crucial part during the reconnaissance phase. It uses three (3) modes:

* Services (Collecting subdomains from the below services)
* Dictionary mode for identifying domains (optional)
* Reverse DNS lookups on identified public IPs (optional)

### Wildcard Identification

The utility checks if the given domain or any generated subdomain is a *wildcard* domain or not.

### RDAP Lookups

The utility collects ASN and network information for the identified domains that resolve to public IP Addresses.

### Services

The utility is collecting data from the following services:

### Webhooks [Work In Progress]

In addition to API integration, the tool also enables you to post content to various services such as Slack, Discord and Telegram. 

In a case that you want to consume services that support API keys then you have to place your API keys in the `config.ini` file.

### Dictionary Mode

A file can be given as an input to the `-w (--wordlist)` switch for performing a dictionary discovery. Forward DNS lookup is performed during this time for identifying subdomains.

### Reverse Mode

Reverse Mode is enabled by providing the `--reverse` switch. This mode will perform reverse DNS lookups on the identified public IPs. IP ranges can also be provided using the `--ranges` switch.

### Portscan
Performs a portscan on well-known web ports. The mode can be enabled with `--portscan` and a specific set of ports can be defined with the `-p` switch. By default `--portscan` scans for default ports 80, 443, 8000, 8080, 8443. Alternatively, use with `--portscan -p small/medium/large/huge` or even `--portscan -p 80,443,444,555` for a custom set of ports. Furthermore, http or https is identified, and the resulting URLs for all identified ports are written in the respective urls.txt in the respective directory for the domain.

|Port set|Ports|
|---|---|
|small|80, 443|
|medium|80, 443, 8000, 8080, 8443|
|large|80, 81, 443, 591, 2082, 2087, 2095, 2096, 3000, 8000, 8001, 8008, 8080, 8083, 8443, 8834, 8888, 9000, 9090, 9443|
|huge|80, 81, 300, 443, 591, 593, 832, 981, 1010, 1311, 2082, 2087, 2095, 2096, 2480, 3000, 3128, 3333, 4243, 4567, 4711, 4712, 4993, 5000, 5104, 5108, 5800, 6543, 7000, 7396, 7474, 8000, 8001, 8008, 8014, 8042, 8069, 8080, 8081, 8088, 8090, 8091, 8118, 8123, 8172, 8222, 8243, 8280, 8281, 8333, 8443, 8500, 8834, 8880, 8888, 8983, 9000, 9043, 9060, 9080, 9090, 9091, 9200, 9443, 9800, 9943, 9980, 9981, 12443, 16080, 18091, 18092, 20720, 28017|
